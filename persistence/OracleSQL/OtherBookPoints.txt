UROWID is a pseudocolumn for index-organized tables
testing for NULL means using IS NULL and IS NOT NULL (=NULL won't work)
DISTINCT applies to an entire result list, even without parens
when you subtract 2 dates, the result is the number of days between them
<date> + <number> is the number of days after that date eg. Start_dt + 15
As literals, dates must be enclosed in quotes, & must match nls_date_format
V$NLS_Parameters contains the nls_date_format et al.
between x and y is inclusive to both x and y
in conditions, AND is evaluated before OR
_ (underscore) is the single-char wildcard character
\_ & \% means literal '_' and '%' for LIKE
with instr, the 1st argument is the big string
mod(x,0) always returns x
of all the group functions, only count(x) considers NULL's
avg will not accept date, but round will
RTRIM and LTRIM no longer exist.  They are replaced by TRIM
all date literals must be enclosed in single quotes
in DDsp, sp tells Oracle to spell out the numeric value eg 12 --> twelve
DDth means 19 --> 19th
a share lock means others can't issue DDL statements against the tables
You cannot select a rownum > constant eg. Rownum > 5 not allowed
rownum is generated before order by => it is best used with a top-N query
L is the floating currency symbol eg L99,999.99.  Defaults to $
The symbol L represents is symbolized by is set in NLS_currency
to_char(price,'$9,999.99) is ok
to_char(price,'MI9,999.99) is ok.  The MI means - if the no. is negative
to_char(price,'009,999.99) means give leading zeros if no < 10,000
pairwise comparison: where (period, region) = (select period, region from...)
UNION returns the result set from all queries but eliminates duplicate values from between tables and from within a single table
UNION ALL returns the results from all queries, including duplicate values
INTERSECT returns only those in the result set of both queries
MINUS returns all data from the first query, except for values in the second query
when Oracle executes queries with subqueries, it executes the innermost ones first
an exclusive lock means others can't issue DML stmts against the tables, and won't see the results until a commit
when a user issues a DML, no other user can see the results until the transaction is committed
you autocommit a transaction when you issue a DDL or DCL statement, and when you close SQL*Plus
Oracle automatically rolls back all transactions when a failure occurs
You enclose subqueries or views in parentheses only when something must follow them
ERRORS: errors made by user in PL/SQL blocks
IND_EXPRESSIONS - expression used for function-based indexes
SEGMENTS - segments.  It helps describe tables.
TAB_PRIVS_MADE - permissions granted on table to others in the user's schema
TAB_PRIVS_RECD - opposite of TAB_PRIVS_MADE
if a column has a default value, and you insert a row where the column value is set to NULL, it stays NULL
procedures, function, packages & triggers form subprograms
The PRODUCT_USER_PROFILE table allows you to limit the command you may run from SQL*Plus, by listing commands to set disabled
