How to get ASP.NET to open up a local project on your PC.

Assign yourself local admin rights, install IIS, run that script below to change the registry, and then open up .NET. 
You may want to add IMFNT\username to the list of Administrators for your machine.
"%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\aspnet_regiis.exe" -i 

After you install IIS, select Start if it isn't grayed out already.
