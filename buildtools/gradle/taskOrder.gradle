// The calls doFirst and doLast can be executed multiple times. They add an action to the beginning or the end of the task's actions list. When the task executes, the actions in the action list are executed in order. The << operator is simply an alias for doLast.

task hello << {
    println 'Hello Earth'
}
hello.doFirst {
    println 'Hello Venus'
}
hello.doLast {
    println 'Hello Mars'
}
hello << {
    println 'Hello Jupiter'
}
