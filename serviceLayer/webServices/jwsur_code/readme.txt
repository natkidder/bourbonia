A little of the code has been placed in chapter directories that do not 
correspond to the chapters in the book. For example, at the start
of Chapter 2, I expand on the TimeServer example of Chapter 1; and the
expanded code is in the chapter1 directory rather than the chapter2 
directory. 

There are various readme.txt files in the chapter directories to explain
particularities of the applications.

Please let me know if something's broken. I appreciate your feedback.

For the most part, I've included the source (.java) files but not the
compiled (.class) files, as it's best to regenerate these. 

For commercial Web services such as Amazon, it's also best to regenerate
the wsimport-artifacts (a separate readme.txt goes into the details) 
because these services regularly change their service contracts.
