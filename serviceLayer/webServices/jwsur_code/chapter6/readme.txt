                                     Glassfish Issues

The sample clients assume that Glassfish awaits HTTP requests on port
8081 and HTTPS requests on port 8181.  

The deployable WAR and EAR files are ready to go. The tcJSP.war application
requires that the tc.war Web service be deployed as well.

The JMS servcies can be tested from the Glassfish admin console.
