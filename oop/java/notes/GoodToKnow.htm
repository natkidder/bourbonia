<p>XML file comments are just like HTML file comments</p>

<p>you may unpack an archive by saying <tt>jar xf <i>archive-file</i></tt></p>

<p>to find the object servlet code for a jsp, go to <tt>c:/tomcat/work/Catalina/localhost/<i>[application]</i>/org/apache/jsp/<i>[name]</i>_jsp.java</tt></p>

<p>there should be no punctuation between tag attributes

<p>you may place spaces inside tags</p>

<p>when you cursor loop through a result set, it goes in alphabetical order of the primary key

<p>context objects need to be closed after the connections they engender are closed

<p>you don't need a Statement to have a PreparedStatement

<p>with prepared statements, do <u>not</u> enclose ordered parameters in single quotes, even if they are strings.  The <tt>PreparedStatement</tt> class will take care of that for you.

<p>when deploying a JSP through a JNDI connection pool in GlassFish, have the <tt>context.lookup</tt> argument be the name of either the JDBC resource or the Connection Pool. (not sure which).

<p><tt>c:/Sun/AppServer/jdk/jre/lib/ext</tt> is automatically included in <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>

<p>for EJB's, the deployment descriptor is <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt>

<p>the EJB application name need <u>not</u> be the same as the root of the class names

<p>in an entity bean, the relevant setters and getters in the session beans need <u>not</u> have the exact class name in their name
