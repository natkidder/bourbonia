________________________________________
Scott, Don <scotdo>, 8/22/2012:  Development will be updating the comments.  It is believed that this error is a result of the timing of the processing of a transaction in Omni and the date manipulations in ST4.  The development teams do not believe this would occur in production, and we did not have cases of it in IT.
________________________________________
Narayanan, Neeraja <narayn>, 8/22/2012:  Here is my analysis: Looks like there was some environment issue. RPTV4 did n't take the date from business calendar. In FIS I see business calendar returned 6/01 but RPT used 7/13 to post the transaction. Why I do not know. I couldn't reproduce the issue. When we talked about this in the meeting I thought the business calendar was returning 7/13. But now I saw it was 6/01. There was another allocation 20 minutes later that was submitted on 6/04. Not sure what went wrong at the time this transaction submitted at 15:59. Was 15:59 timing issue? Not sure. So, Susan, Can you test this case again? We will monitor it. Thanks!

Chellappan, Kalaiselvi <chellak>, 10/25/2012:  According to John's response, the data is part of yesterday's file. Please process this data and send the file to ODS. Once done, assign this defect to ODS team

________________________________________
Erramreddy, Sravanthi <erramre>, 10/26/2012:  Looks like this account was originally created in ST4 on 05/23. So the table brokerage_master and SDA_Account table in BCF ST4 database shows this account number.Since the ST2 testing has not started, looks like this account is now migrated from ST4 filenet to ST2 filenet (during the ST2 env set up) and ST4 no more has this account number. I just looked up at GMON data in BCF st2 and I do see the balance for this account number.

First , We need to understand if this account is being tested as part of ST2 or ST4. If ST2, then the ST2 batch need to be executed to send the files to ODS. and make sure these accounts were also replicated in MDM, since this is from 05/23.
________________________________________
Chellappan, Kalaiselvi <chellak>, 10/29/2012:  Sravanthi, I am not sure which accounts you are referring to. If you are referring the accounts/pins in the defect description then please ignore them. Please look into the comments section, Neeraja requested Susan to submit new request/transaction. Susan submitted a new request and specified the details in comments. Please take a look at the below transaction details. The account/pin is available only in ST4 DB not in ST2 DB.

Account: A53007562
Pin: 1707869

Found another issue, will assign the defect after my analysis
________________________________________
Chellappan, Kalaiselvi <chellak>, 10/29/2012:  When account was created, BPEL ST-4 was pointing to Filenet ST-2. So account is present in ST-2 Filenet. Then there was a crossover planned which leaded ST-4 BPEL is now pointing to ST-4 Filenet. Due to Filenet cross environment switch we lost the accounts and kind of no more availbale for testing until Filenet is ready for copying the some data from ST2 to ST4. Assigning the defect to Nirupama to add her comments and assign back to Susan (the originator of the defect)

Froebrich, Erich <froebri>, 11/21/2012:  anytime the allocation is updated in BCF without impacting the SD % in Omni. It could also be participant initiated. If the participant leaves the Pension/Brokerage split the same and only modifies the Brokerage Mutual Fund selections/percentage, then you run into this same situation.

Original defect was a concern because there was $2500 in rejected status and did not appear anywhere.  Now, that the defect has been cleared, what is the expected behavior if the trade is in an ""accepted"" status?  I would think that we wouldn't want to execute a transfer on an account that has something pending to settle.  See attached video.  Thanks!!!

I think the real issue is that fact the on the brokerage orders page the status is displaying as 'Accepted' for transfers that have yet to complete.  Susan is saying she believes these trades should be pending status not accepted status.

Shanmugam, Senniappan <shanmus>, 5/22/2013:   Request you to analysis on this transaction in IT1 env.
________________________________________
Fatovic, Mike <fatomi>, 5/23/2013:  
The T381 is not currently in Omni. The T381 transaction was prevented from being added to Omni because there is some inconsistency in the coding of the transaction. I can not tell you what the specific issue is because the XML below does include all of the transaction attributes. Please check the transaction details that you are attempting to process. You need to check to see if the amount that you are moving from the X3* investment is matching to the amounts that you are attempting to transfer into other Pension funds. I see that there is currently $1,950 sitting in the Omni X3 fund as a result of the manual T381 that was processed on 5/21.
________________________________________
Shanmugam, Senniappan <shanmus>, 5/23/2013:  When the transfer is about to move the money from Brokerage to Pension - we do see the ToInvestments Is populated with <cash>; we believe that it should be populated as (percentage) % as we don't know how much money will be settled from Pershing account.

@Selva - In this case - <cash> value is $2000 and Pershing has settled $1950; when BPEL sends <from=$1950> and <To=$2000>, it receives the below error. Mike is also explained the issue. I am assigning this defect to you for analysis.

Narayanan, Neeraja <narayn>, 5/23/2013:  I see what was sent to BPEL I see brokerage leg has <ns4:FundAmount>2000</ns4:FundAmount> wondering where does BPEL got $1950. This $2000 goes to CREF goes to CREF Money Market. I don't see $1950 in mdm request on from side.
________________________________________
Shanmugam, Senniappan <shanmus>, 5/23/2013:   The issue has addressed in Marjorie's call today.  we are proposed to ask Pershing team to stop calculating the commission on trades while settling the amount in XAT env.

So BPEL works as desgined.

Marjorie - You want to check with Susan  about the status update on TP - Brokerage Leg; hence I am assining this defect to you and please get in touch with TP team, if you require any analysis about UI.

________________________________________
Patel, Nikunjkumar Rajanikant <patenik>, 9/25/2012:  Awaiting business clarification from Heather Scalpato
________________________________________
Patel, Nikunjkumar Rajanikant <patenik>, 9/25/2012:  Assigning to heather : 

Discussion Detail :

Current Scenario :  

max SDA allocation % is 0.5 
so max SDA allowed is (111000 x 0.5) = 55500 
current SDA balance is 75000 
which means the contract is above limit by about 20K 
so 55500 - 75000 = -19.5K

Scalpato, Heather : 

i would think 
it should show what you are above 
and positive

here is my understanding 
i'm over about 20k so I cannot transfer into the fund 
I should show that I am 20k over now 
without the transaction 
and it should be postitive

we need confirm from 
brokerage side too 
but this is my 2 cents

Selva : do not feel to chane UI layer data.
if you wanted the different message for these case, we have to have new rule for this negative scenario and BRMS will pass that value to UI, and UI will show the same value with new custom message for that new rule

Waiting response from Heather :
________________________________________
Scalpato, Heather <scalpat>, 9/25/2012:  I would think we want to show that we are already over 20k so instead of the subtraction have logic that when negative show the amount that you are over already before subtracting the transactional amount.  Traci, what are your thoughts?
________________________________________
Ryan, Scott A <ryansc>, 9/26/2012:  Updating functional area and business process = Brokerage.  Reseting the target release to November.
________________________________________
Grecco, Traci E <grecco>, 10/16/2012:  I don't quite understand why we have a negative number in the first place.   The participant should get the message and be stopped from going over their maximum. Selva lets discuss.
________________________________________
Seenivasan, Selvaraj <seeniva>, 10/16/2012:  Heather/Traci,
Even I do not have any idea about this defect. As per UI display logic, we are getting that value from RPT_V4/BRMS and getting displayed in UI. 
We have this calculation in BRMS(Gaurav's team) and as per Gaurav/Nikunj, its working as per design and calculation logic.
Not sure who can validate the BRMS calculation logic.
Heather,
I'm going to assign this defect back to you for your clarification as we do not have any change in UI/RPT_V4/BRMS.
Gaurav/Nikunj,
Please share your logic with this Traci/Heather. 
Thanks
-Selva

Subject: RE: CLIENT_SYSTEMS.Client_Systems - Defect #19789 - SRK - IWC ART - SDA max investment message is wrong
Traci
There is a defect in the actual calculation and we'll be fixing it as part of November.
But this negative value can still be generated if Current SDA balance is more than Max SDA allowed value.
So do we need to address that as well?
Thanks
Gaurav
My Comments:
1.  There is an issue with the calculation that Gaurav is fixing (per email above) 
2.  Create a new rule that checks for negative. If the value is negative then show the amount as positive (absolute value) with the message: Per your contract, transfers into the Self-Directed Brokerage Account are not permitted if the resulting accumulation in this Account under all of your contracts exceeds ${0}. Please modify your request.

Can you check why the above guid (in Neeraja's comment on 12/28) allowed SDA transfer even if we try to transfer more than SDA max? If you need more info Neeraja or Heather can help on to understand the functionality.
________________________________________

IT-1 guid=""DC9FA438-E5F2-F8F3-7FEA-028D61FF7F87""

As per Greg's comment,
I would expect the rule to state:  Per your contract, transfers into the Self Directed Brokerage Account are not permitted if the resulting accumulation in this Account under all of your contracts exceeds $25,316.48. Please modify your request.

Actual results: Per your contract, transfers into the Self Directed Brokerage Account are not permitted if the resulting accumulation in this Account under all of your contracts exceeds $15395.33. Please modify your 
________________________________________
Patel, Nikunjkumar Rajanikant <patenik>, 4/22/2013: Here are the details for this request:

Balance of contract: $50632.96
Max SD Balance Allowed: (0.5 x 50632.96) = 25316.48
Existing SD Balance: $40711.81

Existing Balance exceeds max allowed by = (40711.81 - 25316.48) = $15395.33

The existing balance is already exceeding the max allowed value by 15395.33 and that is what the rule is returning.
As per the requirements, if the existing balance was exceeding the max allowed the rules return the difference by which this value is being exceeded and not the max allowed value.

As discussed with Traci and Heather
This is for June SRK 2013 Release
________________________________________
Scalpato, Heather <scalpat>, 4/26/2013:  Traci, Heather, Erich, and Greg agree to the following:
1. Change the BRMS rule to show the 50% maximum amount (in this example the 25k) and not the calculated amount (in this example the 15k). 
2. Message change to: Per your plan, transfers into the Self-Directed Brokerage Account are not permitted if the resulting accumulation of all of your brokerage accounts in this plan exceeds $25,316.48. Please modify your request.

Even this defect is used to track the 10555, I've included 10552 message param as well because we do not have any new defect to track the 10552 for transfers subsequent check.

Seenivasan, Selvaraj <seeniva>, 2/28/2013:  Nik,  reg: above (2/28) Samreen's comment, I've updated Shailendra about the process to test the 10552 rule because Samreen's test case is wrong.


Reg: 10555 comment

As per below ST-4 guid=""72F86CA6-AEEB-FCA4-4E6F-36C948A75638"" , looks like we are not getting the params in order which we mentioned/commented/discussed on 1/18 comment because UI is designed to take the params in order and assigned to the below message.

10555= The required minimum amount to invest in <Name of the brokerage fund- pram-1> is $<Subsequent minimum dollars-param-2>, or <percent of contribution representing sub minimum-param-3>% based on your current contribution levels. Please modify and click Preview Changes.

1st Param should be:INVESTMENT 
2nd Param should be:MIN_SUBQ_ALLOC_AMT (dollar value)
3rd param should be:MIN_SUBQ_ALLOC_BMF (percent)

as per below ST-4 guid data, you can see its not in order which I've explained above.

Narayanan, Neeraja <narayn>, 5/20/2013:  The minimum Subsequent amount is $1001as per coherence data. Ph already own $20384. So 1% is coming in percent. As per data it is correct! Rejecting the defect saying as per data the system works as designed.

Shaik, Samreen <shaisa>, 5/21/2013:  
According to Selva's comments on 02/28/2013, this what 10552 rule is.
""In order to invest in <Name of Fund - param-1>, the required minimum amount is $<subsequent minimum dollar amount - param-2> or <representing sub minimum based on source fund selected-param-3>% based on current market value of your chosen source fund. Please modify and click Preview Changes.""

Here Param-3 is subsequent min based in the source fund selected. But the source fund chosen (TIAA-CREF Lifecycle 2020) has a balance of $1242.93

Ph already own $20384 in the To Fund(Fidelity Blue Chip value).
Also if the % is being calculated based on the To Fund balance, then the % value should remain constant for this data irrespective of the source fund chosen. But when the source fund(TIAA Traditional - $1,504,975) is changed, the % is now displayed as 0%.

""The required minimum amount to invest in Fidelity Blue Chip Value is $1001 or 0% of the current market value of your chosen source fund, which may fluctuate. Please modify and click Preview Changes.""

Neeraja : can you take look ?
________________________________________
Narayanan, Neeraja <narayn>, 5/15/2013:  The testcase same like defect 41677. The root cause is same like 41677.
This is wrong test case. Still I tried to find the root cause. Here is the findings:

This happens because of service logic that we have in place as per current design.

In case of brokerage funds, UI can allow participant to add new funds which service has no aware of. To handle the new funds, service adds the brokerage funds what it gets from UI in to the list of funds it gets from omni. Since same fund comes on both from and to side. It is getting duplicated with real balance and 0 balance in brms request. Changing the service logic to fix the wrong test case will impact the genuine test case. So no change will be done on service end. Rejecting the defect saying test case error.

Narayanan, Neeraja <narayn>, 5/20/2013:  BRMS has given its comment why they fire that rule. I have given my comment why BRMS is getting duplicate funds with different balances. The root cause of this issue is same fund on both side. BRMS also giving another message transfer cannot be done on same account. which is correct message for which the trade should be corrected. 95% rule is the side effect of having same fund on both side. If the trade was corrected for same fund error. 95% error will go away automatically. Hope this helps!"

Pension to Brokerage MF 4:00 PM EST

Narayanan, Neeraja <narayn>, 5/20/2013:  1st cases will take 4p.m cut off time. But the last one as per service logic it takes brokerage Mutual fund cut off time. As per Erich, business wants to ignore brokerage mutual fund cutoff time if it is pension to brokerage mutual fund transfer. Service needs some fix....not sure how it can be done. will let you know the findings and possibilities.
________________________________________
Narayanan, Neeraja <narayn>, 5/21/2013:  The fix is available in dev-int. Please test pension to pension, pension to brokerage money market fund, pension to brokerage mutual fund, brokerage mutual fund to pension, brokerage money market to pension, brokerage money market to brokerage mutual fund, brokerage mutual fund to brokerage money market. All flavours of transfer since I touched common code for brokerage cut off time.
This code fix has been done as part of July release so please test in dev-int similar to CR521."

But BRMS sets all the funds eligibility as true at first by default then overrides the eligibility based on rules. So this fund didn't encounter any rule to block the eligibility for transfer from. So this fund still eligible for transfer from. Is it possible to get negative balance for BMF or is it data issue?

Pin 6974382 - Issue no fund displayed in source fund drop down menu. Reason - plan used is 101215 not 100867. Brokerage transfer not allowed for this plan. Omni has money in it but not allowed to transfer out of it by rule 10541 and TIAA traditional has money but blocked to transfer out by rule 10078f. 

Hope this helps!
