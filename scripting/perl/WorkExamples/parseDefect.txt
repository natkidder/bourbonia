Scott, Don <scotdo>, 8/22/2012:  Development will be updating the comments.  It is believed that this error is a result of the timing of the processing of a transaction in Omni and the date manipulations in ST4.  The development teams do not believe this would occur in production, and we did not have cases of it in IT.

Narayanan, Neeraja <narayn>, 8/22/2012:  Here is my analysis: Looks like there was some environment issue. RPTV4 did n't take the date from business calendar. In FIS I see business calendar returned 6/01 but RPT used 7/13 to post the transaction. Why I do not know. I couldn't reproduce the issue. When we talked about this in the meeting I thought the business calendar was returning 7/13. But now I saw it was 6/01. There was another allocation 20 minutes later that was submitted on 6/04. Not sure what went wrong at the time this transaction submitted at 15:59. Was 15:59 timing issue? Not sure. So, Susan, Can you test this case again? We will monitor it. Thanks!
