Transaction Portal - (APM11799)	"Scott, Don &lt;scotdo&gt;, 8/20/2012:  PINs are not in the brokerage database.  Research is being done as to why.  This is probably bad data.<br><p><b>Scott, Don &lt;scotdo&gt;, 8/22/2012:</b>  Development will be updating the comments.  It is believed that this error is a result of the timing of the processing of a transaction in Omni and the date manipulations in ST4.  The development teams do not believe this would occur in production, and we did not have cases of it in IT.
<br><p><b>Narayanan, Neeraja &lt;narayn&gt;, 8/22/2012:</b>  Here is my analysis: Looks like there was some environment issue. RPTV4 did n't take the date from business calendar. In FIS I see business calendar returned 6/01 but RPT used 7/13 to post the transaction. Why I do not know. I couldn't reproduce the issue. When we talked about this in the meeting I thought the business calendar was returning 7/13. But now I saw it was 6/01. There was another allocation 20 minutes later that was submitted on 6/04. Not sure what went wrong at the time this transaction submitted at 15:59. Was 15:59 timing issue? Not sure. So, Susan, Can you test this case again? We will monitor it. Thanks!

<br><p><b>Narayanan, Neeraja &lt;narayn&gt;, 10/23/2012:</b>  Hi Kalai, Can you help us to check what happened to the transfer that was made on 10/02?
<br><p><b>Chellappan, Kalaiselvi &lt;chellak&gt;, 10/24/2012:</b>  Sent email to Pershing, waiting for Pershing response
<br><p><b>Chellappan, Kalaiselvi &lt;chellak&gt;, 10/25/2012:</b>  According to John's response, the data is part of yesterday's file. Please process this data and send the file to ODS. Once done, assign this defect to ODS team
<br><p><b>Erramreddy, Sravanthi &lt;erramre&gt;, 10/26/2012:</b>  Looks like this account was originally created in ST4 on 05/23. So the table brokerage_master and SDA_Account table in BCF ST4 database shows this account number.Since the ST2 testing has not started, looks like this account is now migrated from ST4 filenet to ST2 filenet (during the ST2 env set up) and ST4 no more has this account number. I just looked up at GMON data in BCF st2 and I do see the balance for this account number.
<br>First , We need to understand if this account is being tested as part of ST2 or ST4. If ST2, then the ST2 batch need to be executed to send the files to ODS. and make sure these accounts were also replicated in MDM, since this is from 05/23.<br><p><b>Chellappan, Kalaiselvi &lt;chellak&gt;, 10/29/2012:</b>  Sravanthi, I am not sure which accounts you are referring to. If you are referring the accounts/pins in the defect description then please ignore them. Please look into the comments section, Neeraja requested Susan to submit new request/transaction. Susan submitted a new request and specified the details in comments. Please take a look at the below transaction details. The account/pin is available only in ST4 DB not in ST2 DB.
<br>Account: A53007562<br>Pin: 1707869<br>SSN: 002510052<br>Plan: 100867<br>SubPlan: GA1001<br>Found another issue, will assign the defect after my analysis<br><p><b>Chellappan, Kalaiselvi &lt;chellak&gt;, 10/29/2012:</b>  When account was created, BPEL ST-4 was pointing to Filenet ST-2. So account is present in ST-2 Filenet. Then there was a crossover planned which leaded ST-4 BPEL is now pointing to ST-4 Filenet. Due to Filenet cross environment switch we lost the accounts and kind of no more availbale for testing until Filenet is ready for copying the some data from ST2 to ST4.

<br><p><b>Kanjarla, Nirupama &lt;kanjarl&gt;, 10/29/2012:</b>  I have updated the Filenet Data, please verify and let me know if there are any issues.
